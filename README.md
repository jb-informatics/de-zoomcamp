### Module 01 - Docker & Terraform
This module focuses on using Docker to containerize services such as PostgreSQL and pgAdmin. The [NYC taxi trip dataset](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) is loaded into PostgreSQL for hands-on data ingestion practice. The module also introduces Terraform as an infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool and uses Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as the cloud service provider.
